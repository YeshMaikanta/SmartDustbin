# SmartDustbin
In this Project we are sending message to user when dustbin is full.
This project includes cloud(thingspeak),virtuino(Available on play store),arduino,Wifi module(ESP8266),Ultrasonic Sensor
Through ultrasonic sensor i am measuring the distance filled with garbage
if the distance reaches a certain threshold value,
a buzzer will be used to notify and also a message will be sent to the specified person mobile number so that he can take action on the filled garbage..
This can be implemented on large scale by the municipal corporation/college authority/Company.
This will make municipal work easy ,they need not to come again and again to check that garbage is filled or not.
This will save time as well as will increase efficiency of work by municipal corporation...
